# Example Matrix

This project is a collection of how to do X with Y where X is solving a problem and Y is a language or framework. If you would like to see an problem, language, or framework implmented here. Pleae open an issue. If you have ideas about how to make this more useful for you, please let me know know also.

The goal is to keep this matrix full and with nearly equal width and height. There is an infinite number of problems and at the rate of JS frameworks created the language/framework axis approaches infinite.
